# Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 (Also Known as MSFS2020 or FS2020) Control/Button Mappings

This repository contains recommended control mappings/setups for hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) equipment.

## Equipment That I Use

I use the following:

+ VKB Gunfighter Mark 3 (Mk.III) Base/Gimbal with a Space Combat Edition (SCE) Premium Right Right (i.e., right-handed stick).
The Space Combat Edition is also known as a Kosmosima.

  + In the US, this joystick can be found [here](https://vkbcontrollers.com/?product=gunfighter-mk-ii-space-combat-edition).
  Note that if you place an order, it ships DHL from Asia.

  + The control template file is named **"VKB Space Combat Edition (SCE) AKA Kosmosima Premium Right (Used With VPC CM2 Throttle and Gunfighter Mk.III Base-Gimbal)"**.
  I have a Microsoft PowerPoint (PPTX) version available, which should be editable for most folks.
  I also have a PDF version for folks that want to print and handwrite (or use Adobe Pro).

+ Virpil / VPC CM2 Throttle (i.e., the VPC MongoosT-50CM2 Throttle)

  + This throttle can be found [here](https://virpil-controls.eu/vpc-mongoost-50cm2-throttle.html).
   Note that if you place an order to the US, I _highly recommend_ paying a little extra to ship via DHL.
   For whatever reason, my experience has always been that DHL clears customs much more quickly than other shipping couriers.

  + Based on some advice from agarwaen117 on Reddit, I wanted to use T1 - T4 as momentary on/off switches (flipping up = momentary button press, flipping off = different momentary button press).
  To do this, I had to customize my CM2 setup.
  Review the file **"Virpil CM2 Throttle Customizations for MSFS2020"** for more information on how to replicate my configuration.

  + The control template file is named **"Virpil-VPC MongoosT-50CM2 Throttle With T1-T4 Customized"**.
  I have a Microsoft PowerPoint (PPTX) version available, which should be editable for most folks.
  I also have a PDF version for folks that want to print and handwrite (or use Adobe Pro).

+ NaturalPoint TrackIR 5 (on order)
  + TrackIR does not require any special configuration as far as I know.

## Other Hardware

+ SmoothTrack + opentrack

  + I have also used the SmoothTrack app on my cell phone + opentrack on my Windows system for head tracking.

  + This works, but your cell phone and laptop need to be able to communicate with each other on the network.
  This solution may require adjusting your Windows Firewall or updating the app's IP address setting to reflect the IP address of your laptop.

  + Overall I found it to be slightly clunky and annoying to have my cell phone occupied for this purpose (I basically cannot use my phone at all while playing the game).
  I hope that I like the NaturalPoint TrackIR 5 solution better.

+ Pedals

  + I do not have any pedals, but I may get some in the future.
  Pedals replace the functionality of the joystick twist.

I have other equipment listed in this repository based on replies from the community.
I cannot personally vouch for these as I do not have the equipment.

## Other Notes

You don't have to follow my advice, and there is no "right answer" for how to set up your HOTAS with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.
However, based on my research, there are some conventional ways to use buttons on the stick.
I feel that you should be aware of these conventions so that you do not inadvertently get used to an unconventional control setup, which could lead to issues playing other flight simulators in the future.

+ Big red button near thumb

  + This is called the "pickle button" and is typically used for weapons employment (e.g., dropping bombs).
  There are no weapons in MSFS2020, so I use it for Smart Camera.

+ Button that looks like top-down view of a castle turret near thumb

  + This button is conventionally used for a pilot to control something on an aircraft display.
  I have not found a need for this in MSFS2020, yet.
  So, instead, I use it for pilot Quickviews.

+ Upper-right thumb button

  + This button is conventionally used for trim adjustments, and so that is how I have it configured.
