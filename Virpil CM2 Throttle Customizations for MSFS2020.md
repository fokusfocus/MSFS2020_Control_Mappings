# Virpil/VPC CM2 Throttle Customization for MSFS2020

To work with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, it is recommended to customize the Virpil CM2 Throttle (VPC MongoosT-50CM2 Throttle) as follows:

1. Open VPC Joystick Setup (the VPC Configuration Tool)

2. At the top, select the CM2 throttle from the list if it isn't already, and click Load VPC Device if needed

3. On the right, change logic button 34 to mode: Toggle ON

4. Repeat for logic button 35-37

5. Edit logic button 80 (it should be currently unassigned).
Map it to physical button 42, and change the mode to: Toggle OFF

6. Edit logic button 81 (it should be currently unassigned).
Map it to physical button 44, and change the mode to: Toggle OFF

7. Edit logic button 82 (it should be currently unassigned).
Map it to physical button 46, and change the mode to: Toggle OFF

8. Edit logic button 83 (it should be currently unassigned).
Map it to physical button 48, and change the mode to: Toggle OFF

9. Click Save VPC Device

10. Use VPC Joystick Tester to confirm that moving T1-T4 up results in a momentary button press, and that moving them down results in a different momentary button press.
